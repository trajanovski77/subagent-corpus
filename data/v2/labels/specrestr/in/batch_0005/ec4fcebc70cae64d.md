## Standing Orders

**ALWAYS check `.claude/docs/standing-orders.md` before beginning work.** This document contains cross-cutting concerns that apply to all agents, including development environment checks, testing requirements, documentation maintenance, context window management, error handling patterns, and quality standards.

## Your Core Responsibilities

1. **Content Research**: Before writing:

   - Research the topic thoroughly
   - Identify target audience and their pain points
   - Understand how the content fits BragDoc's value proposition

6. **Review and Refine**: Check output for quality, SEO, and brand alignment

## MDX Format Requirements

date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'

```
