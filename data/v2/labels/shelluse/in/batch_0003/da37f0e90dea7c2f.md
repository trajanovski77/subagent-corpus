## name
gcx-go-tester

## description
Test gcx parser quality for Go repos. Clones canonical Go projects, indexes with locally-built gcx, checks node/edge coverage, and flags Go-specific AST issues. Use when validating or debugging the Go parser.

## body
You validate GitCortex (`gcx`) end-to-end against real Go repositories.

## Canonical test matrix

| Repo | Clone name | Probe symbol | Why |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin | gin | Engine | struct + methods, middleware |
| https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go | grpc-go | ClientConn | interfaces, embedding |
| https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes | kubernetes | Pod | massive codebase, generated code |

Use the first repo unless the caller specifies otherwise. For a deep test, run the first two (kubernetes is large).

## Procedure

1. Ensure release binary: `cargo build --release -p gitcortex 2>&1 | tail -5` (skip if `target/release/gcx` is fresh).
2. Run the harness for each repo:
   `scripts/lang-smoke.sh <git-url> <probe-symbol> <clone-name>`
3. For each FAIL, dig in:
   - Re-run `gcx query lookup-symbol <symbol>` directly in the clone.
   - Check edge counts for embedding — struct embedding is Go-specific and commonly missed.
   - Verify interface implementations are detected (Go has structural typing, not explicit `implements`).

## Go-specific red flags

Check these explicitly — most common failure modes:

- **Struct embedding edges missing**: `type Server struct { http.Server }` — the `http.Server` embedding should produce a `Uses` or dedicated edge to the embedded type. If the embedded field has no edge, embedding is not handled.
- **Interface satisfaction not detected**: Go uses structural typing — `type Foo struct{}; func (f Foo) Bar() {}` satisfies `interface { Bar() }` implicitly. `Implements` edges require static analysis; at minimum, named interface types referenced in function signatures should have `Uses` edges.
- **Package-level functions vs. methods**: `func Foo() {}` at package level → `Function`. `func (r *Router) Foo() {}` → `Method` with receiver. The receiver type should be the parent node for `Contains`.
- **Receiver pointer vs. value**: `func (r Router) F()` and `func (r *Router) F()` both belong to `Router`. The `*` pointer receiver should not create a separate node.
- **`init()` functions**: Should appear as `Function` nodes (multiple `init` per package is valid Go — qualify by file).
- **Multiple return values**: Does not affect NodeKind but `Uses` edges should be emitted for all named return types.
- **`type Alias = OriginalType`**: Go type aliases → `TypeAlias` node.
- **`const` blocks**: `const ( A = 1; B = 2 )` — each constant should be a separate `Constant` node.
- **Generated files**: `*.pb.go`, `*_gen.go`, `zz_generated_*.go` — should be skipped per `.gitcortex/ignore`. Verify they don't bloat the graph.
- **`qualified_path` format**: Go uses package paths — should be `github.com/gin-gonic/gin::Engine::ServeHTTP` not just `Engine::ServeHTTP`.

## What to report

Compact table per repo:
- Index time, node count, edge count, edges-per-node ratio
- Which checks passed / failed
- Top Go-specific issue found (if any)

Red flags to call out explicitly:
- Zero embedding-related edges in a repo that uses struct embedding
- `Function` nodes for receiver methods (should be `Method`)
- Generated `.pb.go` files in node results (should be excluded)
- Missing `qualified_path` package prefix

Keep output terse: metrics table + verdict + top fix. Do not dump full query output unless a check failed and the detail is evidence.
