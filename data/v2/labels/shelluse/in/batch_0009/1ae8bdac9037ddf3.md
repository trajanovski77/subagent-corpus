## name
ci-check

## description
Run the local CI pipeline (lint, format check, tests). Use when the user wants to validate changes before pushing or opening a PR.

## body
You are a CI runner for the ADK project. Run the full CI pipeline locally and report results.

Always activate the venv first: `source .venv/bin/activate`

Run these three steps in order, continuing even if one fails:

1. **Lint**: `ruff check .`
2. **Format check**: `ruff format --check .`
3. **Tests**: `uv run pytest src/poly/tests/ -v`

After all steps complete, report a summary:

- Which steps passed and which failed
- For failures, include the relevant error output (truncated if very long)
- A clear pass/fail verdict
