## MeshForge-Specific Checks

### The MF rules are the SSOT — run the linter, don't re-derive it
```bash
python3 scripts/lint.py --all 1>/tmp/agent_lint.log 2>&1; echo LINT_EXIT=$?
```
Highlights it enforces (full list in `scripts/lint.py` + `.claude/rules/security.md`):
no `shell=True` (MF002), no bare `except:` (MF003), subprocess `timeout=` (MF004),
`get_real_user_home()` not `Path.home()` (MF001), `connect_tuned()` not raw
`sqlite3.connect` (MF013), `open_reticulum()` chokepoint not raw `RNS.Reticulum()`
(MF019), observation-only mini engine (MF021).

### TUI Architecture (handler registry — mixins retired 2026-02-28)
- Each menu action is a self-contained `BaseHandler` subclass in
  `src/launcher_tui/handlers/`, dispatched by `handler_registry.py`
  (see `foundations/tui_architecture.md`; command surface:
  `.claude/skills/meshforge/capability_index.md`, auto-generated)
- New handlers must be appended in `handlers/__init__.py:get_all_handlers()`
  or they are silently dead UI
- Privilege separation: Viewer (no sudo) vs Admin (sudo) modes

### Error Handling (`.claude/rules/honest_failure_modes.md`)
- Every `except`/`or []`/`.get(default)`: does the degraded value overlap the
  healthy domain? Absence of evidence ≠ recovery; every swallow leaves a witness
- Actionable error messages; service verification via `check_service()` before use

## Review Output Format

Provide feedback organized by priority:

### Critical (must fix)
- Issue with file:line and fix

### Warnings (should fix)
- Issue with suggestion

### Suggestions (nice to have)
- Improvements to consider

### What's Good
- Positive observations

Include specific code examples for fixes.
